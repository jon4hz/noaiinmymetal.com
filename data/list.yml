# General info and list items for No AI In My Metal
why: |
  AI has many uses, but replacing human creativity in the metal scene is not one of them.
  This website documents entities that promote or profit from AI-generated artwork, undermining
  real artists, designers, photographers, and illustrators who give the scene its soul.

  We encourage fans, bands, organizers, and shops to support human-made art.
