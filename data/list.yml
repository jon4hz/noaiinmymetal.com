# General info and list items for No AI In My Metal
why: |
  AI has many uses, but replacing human creativity in the metal scene is not one of them.
  This website documents entities that promote or profit from AI-generated artwork, undermining
  real artists, designers, photographers, and illustrators who give the scene its soul.

  We encourage fans, bands, organizers, and shops to support human-made art.

      Databots seem to be a cross between a band, a hackathon team, and an ephemeral research lab. In their FAQ they are looking
      forward to being the scapegoat if musicians loose their job.

      The festival announced a band called "Absolut Emmental" to play on their main stage at 00:05 (prime time).
      However, this band seems to be entirely AI-generated, and there is nothing to be found about them online.

      They have no social media presence, no released music, nothing. The only thing Rock the Lakes announced about this band was that their festival boss is the vocalist of this band.

      Several people have pointed that out that this announcement was not okay and demanded a statement from the festival. All they have done was to remove their instagram post and ban people on their social media - that's a statement in itself if you ask me.

      This store lists multiple designs that are AI-generated, often mimicking known artists' styles without attribution.
      Consider supporting stores that employ human artists instead.
